## Activity 3: Parameter Play with Segregation

**Using the Segregation model, predict what happens:**

- Set "%-similar-wanted" to 30% (agents want 30% similar neighbors)
- Click "setup" then "go forever"
- Let it run until it stops changing

```{admonition} Key Insight
:class: important

**Small individual preferences can create dramatic collective outcomes!** Even when people only want 30% similar neighbors, you often get neighborhoods that are 80%+ segregated.
```

**Try different tolerance levels:**

- 10% (very tolerant)
- 50% (moderate preference)  
- 80% (strong preference)

How does each change the final segregation pattern?
