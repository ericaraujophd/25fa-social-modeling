# Module 4: Cooperation

Welcome to the Cooperation Models module! This module explores one of the most fundamental questions in social science: how and why do humans c**Study Groups and Office Hours:**
- üïê **Instructor Office Hours:** Tuesdays & Thursdays 2-4 PM
- üí¨ **Course Forums:** Use Moodle for quick questions and discussionsrate? We'll use game theory and agent-based modeling to understand the conditions that promote or hinder cooperation in social systems.

## Overview

Cooperation models help us understand how individuals can work together for mutual benefit, even when short-term self-interest might suggest otherwise. Through computational modeling, we'll explore classic cooperation dilemmas, evolutionary strategies, and the role of reputation, punishment, and reward systems in maintaining cooperative behavior.

## üéØ Student Learning Objectives (SLOs)

```{admonition} Learning Goals
:class: tip

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

**Conceptual Understanding:**
- Explain the fundamental cooperation dilemmas (Prisoner's Dilemma, Public Goods, etc.)
- Understand evolutionary approaches to cooperation and reciprocity
- Analyze the role of institutions, norms, and sanctions in promoting cooperation
- Evaluate different mechanisms for solving collective action problems

**Technical Skills:**
