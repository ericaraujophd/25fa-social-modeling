# Module 2: Segregation

Welcome to the Segregation Models module! This section explores computational models of residential segregation, building on Thomas Schelling's groundbreaking work {cite}`schelling1971dynamic` on how individual preferences can lead to collective patterns of segregation.

## Overview

Segregation models help us understand how micro-level individual choices can lead to macro-level social phenomena {cite}`schelling1978micromotives`. Through agent-based modeling, we'll explore how even mild preferences for similarity can result in highly segregated neighborhoods, providing insights into urban dynamics and social processes.

## 🎯 Student Learning Objectives (SLOs)

```{admonition} Learning Goals
:class: tip

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

**Conceptual Understanding:**
- Explain the difference between individual preferences and collective outcomes
- Analyze how threshold models work in social systems
- Evaluate the relationship between micro-motives and macro-behavior

**Technical Skills:**
- Implement Schelling's segregation model in NetLogo
- Modify agent rules and parameters to test different scenarios
- Collect and analyze data from agent-based simulations

**Critical Thinking:**
- Assess the implications of segregation models for real-world policy
- Compare model predictions with empirical data on residential patterns
- Critique the assumptions and limitations of segregation models

**Communication:**
- Present findings from simulation experiments clearly
- Discuss ethical implications of segregation research
- Connect model insights to contemporary social issues
