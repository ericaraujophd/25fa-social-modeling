# Module 1: Introduction

Welcome to the Introduction to Social Computing and Modeling module! This foundational module introduces the intersection of computer science and social science, exploring how computational methods can help us understand human behavior and social phenomena.

## Overview

This module provides the theoretical and practical foundations for the course. We'll explore what models are, why they're useful in social science research, and how computational approaches can reveal insights about complex social systems. You'll learn the basics of agent-based modeling and get hands-on experience with NetLogo.
