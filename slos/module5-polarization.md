# Module 5: Polarization

Welcome to the Polarization Models module! This module explores how groups form opposing viewpoints, how moderate positions erode, and how soci**Study Groups and Office Hours:**

## Overview

Polarization models help us understand one of the most pressing challenges of contemporary society: how and why groups become increasingly divided in their beliefs, values, and behaviors. Through agent-based modeling, we'll explore opinion dynamics, the role of social networks, media influence, and institutional factors that contribute to societal polarization and potential interventions.
