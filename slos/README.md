# Student Learning Objectives (SLOs) - Course Modules

This folder contains the detailed Student Learning Objectives and module pages for all course modules. Each file provides comprehensive information about learning goals, assignments, readings, and resources for students.

## Module Structure

Each module page includes:

- **Learning Objectives** - Detailed SLOs organized by skill type
- **Course Materials** - Lecture slides, readings, and videos
- **Assignments** - Progressive homework and project components
- **Extra Materials** - Additional resources, tools, and real-world applications
- **Timeline** - Weekly schedule and due dates
- **Support** - Office hours, study groups, and help resources

## Modules

### [Module 1: Introduction to Social Computing and Modeling](module1-introduction.md)

## Course Progression

The modules are designed to build upon each other:

1. **Foundation** (Module 1) - Basic concepts and tools
2. **Spatial Models** (Module 2) - Location-based agent interactions
3. **Temporal Dynamics** (Module 3) - Time-based spreading processes
4. **Strategic Interactions** (Module 4) - Game theory and decision making
5. **Information Dynamics** (Module 5) - Belief formation and change

## Assessment Philosophy

Each module combines:

- **Technical Implementation** - Building models in NetLogo
- **Conceptual Understanding** - Connecting theory to real-world phenomena
- **Critical Analysis** - Evaluating model assumptions and limitations
- **Communication Skills** - Presenting results and implications

## Using These Materials

These module pages serve as:

- **Student Reference** - Comprehensive guide to expectations and resources
- **Instructor Guide** - Detailed curriculum with assignments and readings
- **Assessment Framework** - Clear rubrics and learning objectives
- **Resource Database** - Curated readings, tools, and examples
