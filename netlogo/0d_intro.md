# Your First Model Experience (20 min)

Let's explore classic models to see NetLogo in action.

## Activity 1: Wolf Sheep Predation

**Step 1: Open the model**

- File → Models Library  
- Browse to "Biology" → "Wolf Sheep Predation"
- Click "Open"

**Step 2: Explore the interface**

- **Sliders (1):** initial-number-sheep, initial-number-wolves, etc.
- **Buttons (2):** setup, go, go (forever)
- **Plots (3):** populations over time
- **Monitors (4):** current populations
- **Choosers (5):** select model version
- **Switches (6):** toggle features like "show energy"

**Step 3: Run your first simulation**

- Click **"setup"** (creates initial population)
- Click **"go"** several times (runs step-by-step)
- Or click **"go forever"** (runs continuously)

```{admonition} What Do You Notice?
:class: question

- How do sheep (white) and wolves (black) move?
- What happens when wolves and sheep meet?
- How do population numbers change over time?
- Do you see cycles or patterns?
```

**Step 4: Experiment with parameters**

- Reset: Click "setup"
- Change "initial-number-wolves" to 250 (very high)
- Click "setup" then "go" - what happens?
- Try very few wolves (10) - how does this change things?

## Activity 2: Exploration Exercise

**Your turn!** Pick any model from the Models Library and explore for 10 minutes.

**Suggested models for social scientists:**

- **Segregation** (Social Science) - neighborhood preferences and segregation
- **Voting** (Social Science) - how voting behaviors spread
- **Cooperation** (Social Science) - prisoner's dilemma strategies  
- **Traffic Basic** (Social Science) - traffic jams from individual decisions

**For each model:**

1. **Read the Info tab** - what is this about?
2. **Run with default settings** - what happens?
3. **Change parameters** - how do outcomes change?
4. **Form a hypothesis** - "If I change X, then Y will happen"
5. **Test it** - were you right?

**Share one surprising discovery:** What model did you choose and what surprised you most?
