# Interface Tour (15 min)

Let's explore the four main areas of NetLogo. We will use the Traffic Grid model as an example, but these concepts apply to all models. 

```{important}
To open the **Traffic Grid model**, go to File → Models Library, then browse to "Social Science" → "Traffic Grid" and click "Open".
```

## 1. World View (where agents live and move)

- This is the "stage" where your social drama unfolds
- Agents appear as colored shapes that move and interact
- Think of it as looking down at a city from above

## 2. Interface Tab (buttons, sliders, plots you can interact with)

The Figure below shows a typical model interface:

- **Sliders (1):** Adjust parameters like "how many people?" or "how fast do they move?"
- **Monitors (2):** Display current values like "average wealth"
- **Buttons (3):** Start, stop, and control your model
- **Switches (4):** Toggle options on and off
- **Plots (5):** Graphs showing data over time

## 3. Code Tab (where the magic happens - but don't worry!)

- Contains the "rules" that tell agents what to do
- Uses English-like commands: `move-forward`, `turn-right`
- We'll start by reading code, not writing it

## 4. Info Tab (documentation and explanations)

- Always read this first when exploring a model!
- Explains what the model does and what to look for
- Provides background and references
