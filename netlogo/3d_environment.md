# What We've Accomplished

## Learning Objectives Achieved

By completing this tutorial, you can now:

✓ **Understand the role of environment in agent-based models**  
✓ **Create meaningful environmental visualizations**  
✓ **Implement agent-environment interactions**

---

## What's Next?

Now you have all the building blocks - agents, environment, and interactions. Time to put it all together into your first complete model from scratch!

:class: note

- Planning before programming
- Step-by-step model building  
- Testing and debugging
- Documentation and sharing

**Mini-project preview:** Build a simple "ants following pheromone trails" model that combines everything you've learned!
```

**Think about:** What complete model would you like to build? What social phenomenon interests you? What agents and environment would you need?
