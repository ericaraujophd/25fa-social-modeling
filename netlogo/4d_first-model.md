# What We've Accomplished

## Learning Objectives Achieved

By completing this tutorial, you can now:

✓ **Plan and implement a complete simple model**  
✓ **Use iterative development process**  
✓ **Document models clearly for others**  
✓ **Debug common problems**

---

## What's Next?

You can now build complete models! Next we'll learn how to collect meaningful data from your models and analyze the results systematically.

- Why data matters in modeling
- Using NetLogo's built-in analysis tools
- Exporting data for external analysis
- Designing systematic experiments

**Activities preview:**
- Experiment Design: Plan systematic studies
- Data Visualization: Create meaningful charts and graphs
```

**Congratulations!** You've built your first complete agent-based model from scratch. This is a significant achievement that many researchers never accomplish.
