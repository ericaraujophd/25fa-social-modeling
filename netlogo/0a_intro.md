# What is NetLogo? (5 min)

NetLogo is a **visual programming environment for agent-based modeling** - think of it as a virtual laboratory where you can:

- Create "agents" (people, animals, organizations) that follow simple rules
- Watch how individual behaviors create complex collective patterns  
- Test "what if" scenarios by changing rules and seeing results

Used by Researchers Worldwide (Not Just Programmers!):

- **Economists** model market dynamics and trading behaviors
- **Sociologists** study how social norms spread through communities  
- **Political scientists** explore voting patterns and coalition formation
- **Urban planners** analyze traffic flow and city development
- **Epidemiologists** track disease spread and intervention strategies

## **Examples of famous models built in NetLogo:**

- Thomas Schelling's [segregation model](https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Social%20Science/Segregation.nlogo) (Nobel Prize winner)
- Robert Axelrod's [cooperation tournaments](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rikblok/science/models/axelrods_tournament/index.html)
- Models of [financial markets and economic bubbles](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Artificial%20Financial%20Market)

Spend some time exploring the models in the NetLogo Models Library. Click in the links above and read the Info tab for each model to learn more about what they do. Don't feel overwhelmed by the amount of information - just get a sense of the variety of models available.
