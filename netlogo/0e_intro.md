## What's Next?

In the next section, we'll peek "under the hood" to see how these models work. But don't worry - we'll start with simple concepts that build your confidence step by step.

```{important} Coming Up: Basic Programming Concepts
:class: important

- Programming = giving detailed instructions (like a recipe)
- Variables, commands, and procedures in plain English
- Reading code before writing code
- Making small modifications to existing models
```

**Preparation for next time:** Think about a social phenomenon you'd like to model. What individual behaviors might create interesting collective patterns?
