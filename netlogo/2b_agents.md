# Meet the Turtles (10 min)

## Turtles = Individual Agents in Your Model

In NetLogo, **turtles represent the individual actors** in whatever social system you're studying:

**Examples:**

- **Sociology:** People in a neighborhood, members of an organization
- **Economics:** Individual traders, consumers, firms
- **Political Science:** Voters, political parties, countries
- **Psychology:** Individual decision-makers with different cognitive styles

## Each Turtle Has Properties

Just like real people have characteristics, each turtle can have properties:

**Built-in properties (every turtle has these):**

- `color` - what color is this turtle?
- `size` - how big should this turtle appear?
- `xcor` and `ycor` - where is this turtle located?
- `heading` - which direction is this turtle facing?
- `who` - what is this turtle's unique ID number?

**Custom properties (you define these):**

- `age` - how old is this person?
- `wealth` - how much money does this person have?
- `opinion` - what does this person believe about an issue?
- `social-connections` - how many friends does this person have?

## Turtles Can Move, Interact, Make Decisions

Turtles aren't just static dots - they can:

- **Move** around the world following rules
- **Interact** with other nearby turtles  
- **Make decisions** based on their situation
- **Change** their properties over time
- **Remember** things that happened to them

```{admonition} Key Insight
:class: tip

**Individual turtle behaviors create collective patterns.** When hundreds of turtles follow simple rules, complex social phenomena emerge that no single turtle "intended" or "planned."
