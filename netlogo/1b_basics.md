# Programming Without Fear (10 min)

Let's start with a fundamental truth: **Programming is just giving detailed instructions to a computer.**

## Programming = Giving Detailed Instructions

```{admonition} Programming is Like...
:class: tip

**Writing a recipe:**
- Step 1: Heat oven to 350Â°F
- Step 2: Mix flour and sugar
- Step 3: Add eggs one at a time

**Giving directions:**  
- Step 1: Go straight for 2 blocks
- Step 2: Turn left at traffic light
- Step 3: Building is on your right

**Programming:**
- Step 1: Create 100 turtles  
- Step 2: Ask each turtle to move forward
- Step 3: If turtle sees neighbor, turn right
```

The only difference: computers need **very precise** instructions and can't fill in missing details like humans can.

**Like Writing a Recipe or Assembly Instructions**

Think about IKEA furniture instructions - they're extremely detailed because they assume you know nothing. Programming is the same way!

## NetLogo Uses English-like Commands

Unlike many programming languages, NetLogo reads almost like English:

- `create-turtles 50` (create 50 turtles)
- `forward 1` (move forward 1 step)  
- `set color red` (change color to red)
- `count neighbors` (how many neighbors do I have?)

You can see most of the commands in the {ref}`wordcloud-ref`.

Also, Netlogo provides a dictionary of commands in their website: [NetLogo Dictionary](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html).
