## Learning Path

```{note}
**Prerequisites:** Complete [Tutorial 0: NetLogo Introduction & Interface](../0_intro.md) before starting these programming tutorials.
```

**Recommended progression:**

1. Start with basic concepts and work through each tutorial sequentially
2. Complete all activities and exercises in each tutorial
3. Build the example models to reinforce learning
4. Use the troubleshooting guide when you encounter problems

**Time commitment:** Plan for approximately 5 hours total to complete all programming tutorials with activities.

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

- Review the troubleshooting section in Tutorial 6
- Check that you've completed prerequisites
- Try simplifying your code and building complexity gradually
- Ask questions during class or office hours

**Good luck with your modeling journey!**
