# What We've Accomplished

## Learning Objectives Achieved

By completing this tutorial, you now:

✓ **Understand that code is just detailed instructions**  
✓ **Recognize basic programming concepts in NetLogo syntax**  
✓ **Can read and interpret simple NetLogo procedures**  
✓ **Feel prepared to modify existing code**

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basic building blocks, we'll learn how to work with individual agents (turtles) - creating them, controlling them, and making them interact.

```{admonition} Coming Up: Working with Agents
:class: seealso

- Creating and controlling turtle agents
- Giving turtles different properties  
- Making turtles interact with each other
- Building simple collective behaviors

**Activities preview:**
- Build a Flock: Make turtles move together
- Random Walk: Turtles explore randomly  
- Color Copying: Turtles influence each other
```

**Think about:** What kinds of agents would you want in a model of your research interest? What properties would they need? What behaviors?
