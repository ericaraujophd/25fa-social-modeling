# Planning Before Programming (15 min)

Good models start with good plans. Let's think through the process systematically.

## What Question Are You Trying to Answer?

Every model should address a specific question about social phenomena:

**Good research questions:**

- "How do individual preferences for similar neighbors lead to residential segregation?"
- "What factors determine whether cooperation emerges in a group?"
- "How does information spread through a social network?"

**Too vague:**

- "How do people behave?"
- "What makes societies work?"

```{admonition} Your Research Question
:class: question

**Think of a social phenomenon that interests you:**

- Voting behavior in elections
- Formation of friendships in school
- Spread of fashion trends
- Traffic jam formation
- Economic inequality

**Turn it into a specific question:** "How does [individual behavior] lead to [collective outcome]?"
```

## What Are Your Agents and What Do They Do?

Once you have a question, design your agents:

**Agent properties:** What characteristics do they have?

- Demographics (age, income, education)
- Preferences (risk tolerance, social orientation)  
- States (opinion, mood, health status)
- Resources (money, time, information)

**Agent behaviors:** What actions can they take?

- Movement (where do they go?)
- Communication (who do they talk to?)
- Decision-making (how do they choose?)
- Learning (how do they adapt?)

## What Does Success Look Like?

Define what patterns you expect to see:

- **Segregation model:** Clusters of similar agents
- **Cooperation model:** Stable cooperation despite temptation to defect
- **Information spread:** Rapid diffusion through social networks

**Success criteria:**

- Model produces realistic patterns
- Changing parameters creates predictable changes
- Results provide insights about real-world phenomena
