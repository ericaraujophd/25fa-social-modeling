# What We've Accomplished

## Learning Objectives Achieved

By completing this tutorial, you can now:

✓ **Create and control basic turtle agents**  
✓ **Understand how individual agent rules create collective patterns**  
✓ **Modify turtle properties and behaviors**  
✓ **Implement simple agent interactions**

---

## What's Next?

Now that you can work with agents, let's explore their environment! Agents don't exist in a vacuum - they live in a world that shapes their behavior.

- Understanding the world patches live in
- Using patch colors to visualize data
- Agent-environment interactions  
- Creating environmental gradients
```

- Heat Map: Create temperature gradients
- Foraging: Agents seek resource-rich areas
- Erosion: Agents modify their environment
```

**Think about:** In your research area, what kind of environment do agents live in? Physical space? Social networks? Economic markets? Information landscapes?
