# NetLogo Tutorial Series

```{attention} Total time commitment:
Approximately 6 hours across 7 tutorials
```

Welcome to the NetLogo programming material designed specifically for this class. We assume students may not have any prior programming experience. And that's okay! We will walk through the basics of programming in NetLogo, and also learn in class what it feels like building code for modeling social behavior.

## Course Overview

This course teaches agent-based modeling using NetLogo, a powerful yet accessible programming environment. You'll learn to create computational models that help answer questions about social phenomena.

```{note}
**No programming background required!** This course is designed for students who have never programmed before. We start with basic concepts and build gradually.
```

### Learning objectives

By completing this tutorial series, you will be able to:

- Create agent-based models from scratch
- Understand how individual behaviors create collective patterns
- Use computational tools to explore social behavior questions
- Analyze and interpret model results
- Extend existing models for new research questions

### Why NetLogo for social models?

- Visual programming environment reduces intimidation
- Designed specifically for modeling social phenomena
- Large community of non-CS users
- Extensive library of existing models to learn from

## Learning Approach

This course uses a **learning-by-doing** approach:
- Start with exploration and experimentation
- Build understanding through hands-on activities
- Progress from simple concepts to complete models
- Focus on visual and conceptual understanding first
