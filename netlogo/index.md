# NetLogo Tutorial Series

Welcome to the NetLogo programming course designed specifically for social science students with no prior programming experience.

## Course Overview

This course teaches agent-based modeling using NetLogo, a powerful yet accessible programming environment. You'll learn to create computational models that help answer questions about social phenomena.

**Total time commitment:** Approximately 6 hours across 7 tutorials

## Tutorial Structure

### Getting Started
**[Tutorial 0: NetLogo Introduction & Interface](0_intro.md)** (40 minutes)
- What is NetLogo and why use it?
- Exploring the NetLogo interface
- Running your first model

### Programming Skills
The `coding/` folder contains hands-on programming tutorials:

**[Programming Tutorial Series](coding/index.md)**
- Tutorial 1: Basic Programming Concepts (50 min)
- Tutorial 2: Working with Agents (60 min) 
- Tutorial 3: Environment and Patches (40 min)
- Tutorial 4: Building Your First Complete Model (55 min)
- Tutorial 5: Data Collection and Analysis (45 min)
- Tutorial 6: Advanced Topics and Troubleshooting (45 min)

## Learning Approach

This course uses a **learning-by-doing** approach:
- Start with exploration and experimentation
- Build understanding through hands-on activities
- Progress from simple concepts to complete models
- Focus on visual and conceptual understanding first

```{note}
**No programming background required!** This course is designed for students who have never programmed before. We start with basic concepts and build gradually.
```

## Course Philosophy

**Why NetLogo for social scientists?**
- Visual programming environment reduces intimidation
- Designed specifically for modeling social phenomena
- Large community of social science users
- Extensive library of existing models to learn from

**Learning objectives:**
By completing this tutorial series, you will be able to:
- Create agent-based models from scratch
- Understand how individual behaviors create collective patterns
- Use computational tools to explore social science questions
- Analyze and interpret model results
- Extend existing models for new research questions

## Getting Started

**Begin with:** [Tutorial 0: NetLogo Introduction & Interface](0_intro.md)

**Prerequisites:** None! Just curiosity about social phenomena and willingness to experiment.

**What you'll need:**
- NetLogo software (free download from netlogo.org)
- Willingness to try things and make mistakes
- Notebook for observations and questions
