# NetLogo Programming Tutorials

Welcome to the NetLogo programming course! This series of tutorials is designed for social science students with no programming background. By the end of this course, you'll be able to create sophisticated agent-based models to explore social phenomena.

```{note}
**Target Audience:** Undergraduate/graduate students in social sciences  
**Prerequisites:** None - designed for complete beginners  
**Time Commitment:** Approximately 6-8 hours total across all tutorials
```

## Course Overview

This course takes a hands-on, visual approach to learning programming. We start with NetLogo's graphical interface and gradually introduce programming concepts through building increasingly complex social models.

### Learning Philosophy

```{admonition} Why NetLogo for Social Scientists?
:class: tip

**Visual and Intuitive:** See your code running in real-time with moving agents  
**Social Science Focus:** Built-in concepts like agents, networks, and spatial relationships  
**Immediate Results:** Create interesting models from day one  
**Research-Ready:** Professional tool used in published research  
**Transferable Skills:** Programming concepts apply to other languages
```

## Getting Started

```{admonition} Before You Begin
:class: important

1. **Install NetLogo** from [https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml)
2. **Download course materials** (if provided by instructor)
3. **Set aside uninterrupted time** - each tutorial takes 45-90 minutes
4. **Have a research question in mind** - you'll build models related to your interests

**System Requirements:**
- Any modern computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- At least 2GB of RAM
- Java 8 or higher (usually installed automatically with NetLogo)
```

## Success Tips

```{admonition} How to Succeed in This Course
:class: tip

**Practice Actively:** Type code yourself rather than just reading  
**Start Simple:** Master basics before attempting complex features  
**Embrace Errors:** Debugging is a core programming skill  
**Ask Questions:** Use online resources and ask for help when stuck  
**Think Conceptually:** Focus on modeling social processes, not just code syntax  
**Iterate Frequently:** Build models step-by-step, testing as you go
```
