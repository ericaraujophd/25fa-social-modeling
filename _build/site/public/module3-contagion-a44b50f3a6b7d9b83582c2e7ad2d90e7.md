# Module 3: Contagion Models

Welcome to the Contagion Models module! This module explores how ideas, behaviors, diseases, and innovations spread through social networks and populations. We'll examine both biological and social contagion processes using computational modeling approaches.

## Overview

Contagion models help us understand how things spread - from infectious diseases to social movements, from rumors to technological innovations. Through agent-based modeling, we'll explore different mechanisms of transmission, the role of network structure, and intervention strategies for controlling or promoting different types of contagion.
