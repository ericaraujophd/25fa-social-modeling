# Segregation Models

Welcome to the Segregation Models module! This section explores computational models of residential segregation, building on Thomas Schelling's groundbreaking work on how individual preferences can lead to collective patterns of segregation.

## Overview

Segregation models help us understand how micro-level individual choices can lead to macro-level social phenomena. Through agent-based modeling, we'll explore how even mild preferences for similarity can result in highly segregated neighborhoods, providing insights into urban dynamics and social processes.

## üéØ Student Learning Objectives (SLOs)

```{card} Learning Goals

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

**Conceptual Understanding:**
- Explain the difference between individual preferences and collective outcomes
- Analyze how threshold models work in social systems
- Evaluate the relationship between micro-motives and macro-behavior

**Technical Skills:**
- Implement Schelling's segregation model in NetLogo
- Modify agent rules and parameters to test different scenarios
- Collect and analyze data from agent-based simulations

**Critical Thinking:**
- Assess the implications of segregation models for real-world policy
- Compare model predictions with empirical data on residential patterns
- Critique the assumptions and limitations of segregation models

**Communication:**
- Present findings from simulation experiments clearly
- Discuss ethical implications of segregation research
- Connect model insights to contemporary social issues
